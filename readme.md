# Grio Code Challenge -- "Code Star" By Jose Climaco

Tech spec:
    angular 1.3.0
    bootstrap 3.1.1

I decided to make some changes to the original spec I hope you don't mind.

## Features:
Enter any amount of users you want
Display total stars for each user
Display an average "stars per repo" for each user
Declare a winner
Display a Score based on total number of stars, forks, open issues and information pages

## Features i would add in the future
Consider public repo contributions as well (i don't think its possible with the actual api)
Gamify it a bit more


## Instructions
It comes with all the components needed to work and it doesn't use any server side languages, so you can run it in the browser.

1. Just open the index.html page
2. Add several users
3. press Start Comparison
4. Enjoy the results




## Notes
It was a small fun project.

Thanks for the opportunity!
